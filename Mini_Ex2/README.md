# Mini_Ex2:
**Objective:**
To comprehend the the notion of fun through eksperimenting
with computational drawing possibilities, and Goriunova's text.

### FUN.js
This might sound weird but i found that this mini_ex2 was actually quite hard to do, 
compared with my previous mini_ex1. I think that one of the reasons why is that I have been sick, 
and i have therefore strugled with finding my inner humoristic programmer. I have during the past week had the sensation of having a head filled with this slippery aqueous secretion substanse, whos only way of escaping was through my nose. This has led to my nose feeling sort of disemboidiet with the rest of my face.
