# Mini_Ex1:
**Objective:**
- To learn the basic setup, including independent study of code syntax, uploading files on github, creating a readme file, etc.
- To get familiar with the building and feedback process of weekly mini exercises
- To reflect upon the process of coding


A screenshot about your program
A URL link to your program and run on a browser, see: https://rawgit.com/
Describe your first independent coding process (in relation to thinking, reading, copying, modifying, writing, uploading, sharing, commenting code)
How your coding process is differ or similar to reading and writing text? (You may also reflect upon Annette Vee's text on coding literacy)
What might be the potential and possibility of coding practice?
