    <h1>Techno_Objectification</h1>
      <p>The objectification of techno is an entity which is rarely seen, it manifests itself through sound. The object is defined by its dark colored exterior, ability to position itself and perform a rotation every now and then. In case you were to encounter one I would Highly suggest to cover your ears with headphones, followed by moving your mouse from left to right. </p>
